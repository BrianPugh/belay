Example 07: LCD
===============

.. image:: images/lcd_demo.jpeg

This example uses the Waveshare 0.96" 160x80 RGB LCD RP2040 module (RP2040-LCD-0.96).

The driver code in the ``board/`` directory was provided by Waveshare.
Their code inside ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` is unnecessary, but was left in for reference.

The code in this example is fairly self-explanatory given previous examples.
This primarily demonstrates a slightly more complicated hardware perhipheral.
