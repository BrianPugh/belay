Belay requires a microcontroller running the MicroPython firmware. See the `official MicroPython Website`_ for details.

Unless otherwise specified, these examples were developed for MicroPython running on the Pi Pico board.

Some examples contain a ``circuitpython.py`` example equivalent.

It is recommended to go through the examples sequentially; concepts covered in previous examples will not be explained in subsequent examples.
